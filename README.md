Diabetes Predictor
Using Machine Learning to Predict Diabetes

The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a patient has diabetes or not based on various features, including Glucose level, Insulin, Age, and BMI. We will follow a structured approach, starting from data gathering to model deployment.

To ensure the success of our project, we will first perform data preprocessing and feature engineering to clean and transform the data into a format suitable for our machine learning algorithms. We will then compare the performance of various algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests, on the basis of multiple evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Based on the results of our evaluation, we will select the best performing algorithm for our final model.

Finally, we will create a user-friendly web app using Flask, a popular Python micro framework, to deploy our model. The app will allow users to input their data and receive a prediction of whether they are at risk of developing diabetes. We will also ensure that the app is secure and scalable to handle multiple user requests

Installation
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine and unzip it.

git clone <repository-url>
  
Navigate to the flask directory of the project in your terminal or command prompt.

Create a new virtual environment with Python 3 and activate it. You can use venv or conda for this step.

python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
  
Install the required packages by running the following command:

python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
  
Start the Flask application by executing the following command:

python3 app.py
  
Finally, open http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your web browser to use the application.
