Diabetes Predictor
Using Machine Learning to Predict Diabetes

The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a patient has diabetes or not based on various features, including Glucose level, Insulin, Age, and BMI. We will follow a structured approach, starting from data gathering to model deployment.

To ensure the success of our project, we will first perform data preprocessing and feature engineering to clean and transform the data into a format suitable for our machine learning algorithms. We will then compare the performance of various algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests, on the basis of multiple evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Based on the results of our evaluation, we will select the best performing algorithm for our final model.

Finally, we will create a user-friendly web app using Flask, a popular Python micro framework, to deploy our model. The app will allow users to input their data and receive a prediction of whether they are at risk of developing diabetes. We will also ensure that the app is secure and scalable to handle multiple user requests.
